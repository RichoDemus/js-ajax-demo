js-ajax-demo
============

Super simple ajax-demo:  
It's a static html-file with an empty list  
a javascript-function that fetches a list of applications on window.onload  
a static api that just returns 3 applications  
and then the javascript function puts those applications in the list  

##Running
mvn tomcat7:run  
browse to [localhost](http://localhost/)
